# Update 2021-05-14

LolTracker v2 (renamed to LoL Automated Video Analyser - LAVA) beta has now been released. I'll continue to add new champions to LolTracker as it's a quick job but for the most part, all updates will now be made to LAVA and the sun is setting on LolTracker

You can find the new project [here](https://github.com/Steeeephen/LAVA). There are still bugs to work through and features to add but I'm excited to share this new development with the public. Thanks for all the support so far!
