DEPRECATION WARNING:

Loltracker 2.0 will be released by the end of ~~March/Mid-April~~ ~~April/Mid-May (sorry)~~ sometime in the next couple of months (work is busy and the 2021 change to broadcast overlays delayed things heavily, will continue to work on it but I may need to scale down a bit). Thus, **all 1.x versions can now be considered deprecated** (but for how long? who knows, they still work for videos using the default overlay)
